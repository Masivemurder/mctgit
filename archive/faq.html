				<ul>
					<li><strong>Q. I have been refused credit. Can I do something about it?</strong>
<p>
			  A. Absolutely! Nearly 90% of Americans, just like you, have some blemish 
			  on their credit reports. Due to the nature of the credit reporting industry, 
			  those blemishes can be mistakenly included on your record. Frequently, 
			  credit reports contain outdated information, unverifiable negative items, 
			  or totally inaccurate entries. Under the law the credit reporting companies 
			  must remove such information. You should check your credit report and 
			  see why you were, or may be, denied credit. Then, as a Credit Investigation 
			  Service Customer, you can do something to correct the mistakes and have 
			  your report corrected.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. Are "credit reporting agencies" a part of government?</strong>
<p>
			  A. No. Credit reporting companies are just that - companies. They are in 
			  business to make a buck, just like the mega-billion-dollar banks that run 
			  the credit card businesses VISA, and MasterCard. The credit reporting 
			  business is a multi-billion dollar industry. They generate their income 
			  by selling credit reports to creditors.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. Is it illegal or immoral to have your credit profile improved?</strong>
<p>
			  A. No. It is not illegal or immoral to eliminate mistakes on your credit report. 
			  In fact the federal government, under the 1971 Fair Credit Reporting Act, 
			  Section 1681e, protects your right to do so.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. How does information about me get into my credit report?</strong>
<p>
			  A. When you agree to accept credit from a bank, most retail stores, etc., or 
			  fill out an employment application - if a credit report is used as a background 
			  check - you give the creditor the right to provide information to any credit 
			  reporting company. Additional information about you comes from public 
			  records, such as court records, debt collection companies, and even the utility 
			  companies.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. How often are mistakes entered into my credit file?</strong>
<p>
			  A. Frequently! Some experts say that as many as 90% of credit reports contain 
			  errors! That is inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information that can cost 
			  you the credit you deserve.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. Who will remove items from my credit report?</strong>
<p>
			  A. Only the credit reporting agencies have the power to remove items from 
			  your credit report. But, as required by law, the credit bureaus must delete 
			  inaccurate, unverifiable, or outdated information.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. Should I apply for credit while in the restoration process?</strong>
<p>
			  A. Do not apply for credit during the restoration period. Each time you apply 
			  for credit, an inquiry is recorded on your record and too many inquiries may 
			  be a cause for denial of credit.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. Does paying a past due debt remove the debt from your credit report?</strong>
<p>
			  A. Paying an old collection or charge off does not erase the fact that at one 
			  time you were not paying it as you agreed. As a matter of fact, it updates 
			  your payment history which reduces your score.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. How long does the restoration process take?</strong>
<p>
			  A. It may take 1 to 6 months due to the credit reporting agencies' deliberate 
			  noncompliance of the fair credit reporting act and delaying tactics.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. Can I speed up the process by directly contacting the credit reporting agencies?</strong>
<p>
			  A. No, it is best to have Credit Investigation Service communicate with the credit 
			  reporting agencies on your behalf. If you do receive a request for communication 
			  from the credit reporting agencies, please immediately forward it to Credit 
			  Investigation Service.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. What happens if new, negative information - information that was not on my 
					original report - is added to my report after Credit Investigation Service has begun work 
					on my behalf?</strong>
<p>
			  A. Credit Investigation Service will work on the information in your credit report as 
			  long as you are our customer. The results you provide us will have new activity on 
			  it therefore we will be alerted to any negative information being added onto your 
			  report.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. How do I get my credit reports and/or dispute results to Credit Investigation Service?</strong>
<p>
			  A. You may scan and email them to joann@mycreditteam.com, mail them to Credit 
			  Investigation Service at 425 Murrysville Rd. Trafford, PA 15085, or fax them to our toll 
			  free number (866) 528-8499.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. How will I know the results following the credit reporting agencies review of my file?</strong>
<p>
			  A. You will be the first to know because the credit reporting agencies will write directly 
			  to you. In addition you can track a summary of your results on-line real time by accessing 
			  your private portal.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. Once a Credit Reporting Agency has removed an item from a person's credit report, 
					can it be reinserted?</strong>
<p>
			  A. Credit reporting agencies are often reinserting items that they have previously 
			  removed from a consumer's credit report. According to the FCRA, one of the requirements 
			  for reinsertion of items is that a consumer must be notified within five days when an item 
			  is reinserted. Most consumers are not made aware when these items are reinserted at all, 
			  let alone in five days. That's one of the benefits to our customers when signing up for our 
			  service. They find out when items are reinserted, and then we have the credit reporting 
			  agencies attempt to provide verification the item is in fact accurate, they followed the FCRA 
			  requirements for reinsertion, if they fail to provide this information the item must be 
			  permanently removed.
		  </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. What is Credit Investigation Service's definition of improper negative credit?</strong>
<p>
			  A. Some examples of "improper," or better stated "inaccurate," items on a consumer's credit 
							report are items that either are 1) erroneous - don't belong to the consumer, 2) display 
							inaccurate information about the item, i.e. payment history or dates, or 3) obsolete - have 
							exceeded the reporting timeline for that item.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Q. How is the service provided by Credit Investigation Service for consumer dispute resolution 
					different or better than the current processes being offered by the various Credit Reporting Agencies?</strong>
<p>
			  A. The best analogy that we can offer is, if you have a tax problem, would you call the IRS or 
			  would you find and hire a qualified tax accountant? Most people do not have the time or the 
			  resources to fully understand the FCRA, nor do they want to. We ensure that our customers 
			  have received the proper protection offered them through the FCRA. The credit reporting 
			  agencies are advocates for their customers who are financial and lending institutions. These 
			  are the same companies who may be reporting inaccurate information about you. We are 
			  advocates for our customers, and their consumer rights.
