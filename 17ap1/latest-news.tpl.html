Given the complex way in which  medical bills are charged and paid, it is not uncommon for delays in payment to  tarnish credit reports, often without consumers&rsquo; knowledge. Just last year, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released the results of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-study-finds-medical-debt-overly-penalizes-consumer-credit-scores/" title="The study."><span style="color:#326891; ">its own study</span></a>, based  on five million anonymous credit records, which found that consumers may be  overly penalized for medical debts that go to collections. About half of unpaid  collections on consumers&rsquo; reports are medical-related.</span></p>
